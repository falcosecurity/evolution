# Falco Project Evolution

This repo aims to document the evolution process of The Falco Project.

It is also a place for various community-maintained resources. In particular, this repository provides a space for the community to work, document, and build out third-party integrations in a safe, and productive way.

## Adoption model

The criteria will remain loose, and tighten as needed at the discretion of the Falco open source community.

### Sandbox

The "*Sandbox*" level serves as a place for the community to test-drive ideas/projects/code. 

Resources with this status can be found within this repo:

- [`/deploy`](deploy/) - deployment resources
- [`/examples`](examples/) - various examples
- [`/integrations`](integrations/) - third-party integrations
- *More will come soon!*

> When adding a new directory, propose your motivations to the [maintainers](OWNERS).

### Incubating

The "*Incubating*" level refers to those projects (usually promoted from "*Sandbox*") that need their repository.

This status is assigned as needed, and can best be measured by the need to cut a release and use the GitHub release features.

### Official Support

As the need for a project grows, it can ultimately achieve the highest and most coveted status within The Falco Project: "*Official support*."

Currently, only those artifacts included in the [falcosecurity/falco](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco) repository got the "Official support" status. These artifacts will be refined and amended as per the [Falco Artifacts Scope - Part 2](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/proposals/20200506-artifacts-scope-part-2.md).

The full list of those artifacts can be found within the [official documentation](https://falco.org/docs/download/.)
