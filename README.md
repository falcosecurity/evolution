# Falco Project Evolution

This repo aims to document the evolution process of The Falco Project.

It is also a place for various community-maintained resources. In particular, this repository provides a space for the community to work, document, and build out third-party integrations in a safe, and productive way.

## Adoption model

The criteria will remain loose, and tighten as needed at the discretion of the Falco open source community.

### Sandbox

The "*Sandbox*" level serves as a place for the community to test-drive ideas/projects/code. 

Resources with this status can be found within this repo:

- [`/deploy`](deploy/) - deployment resources
- [`/examples`](examples/) - various examples
- [`/integrations`](integrations/) - third-party integrations
- *More will come soon!*

> When adding a new directory, propose your motivations to the [maintainers](OWNERS).

### Incubating

The "*Incubating*" level refers to those projects (usually promoted from "*Sandbox*") that need their repository.

This status is assigned as needed, and can best be measured by the need to cut a release and use the GitHub release features.

### Official Support

As the need for a project grows, it can ultimately achieve the highest and most coveted status within The Falco Project: "*Official support*."

## Projects

As per [our governance model](https://github.com/falcosecurity/.github/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#adding-new-projects-to-the-falcosecurity-github-organization), to request a project to be added or promoted, please open an [issue](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/issues/new/choose), and choose the appropriate template.

### Special repositories

Some repositories have a special meaning and do not fit the above statuses. These are:

| Repository | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [falcosecurity/.github](https://github.com/falcosecurity/.github) |  This repository holds default community health files, such as the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/falcosecurity/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](https://github.com/falcosecurity/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and [`GOVERNANCE.md`](https://github.com/falcosecurity/.github/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md) files.  |

| [falcosecurity/evolution](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution) |  This repository holds the evolution process of The Falco Project.  |
| [falcosecurity/template-repository](https://github.com/falcosecurity/template-repository) |  This repository holds the template for creating a new project under the [falcosecurity](https://falcosecurity) GitHub's organization.  |

### Archivied repositories

In general, a repository can be archived at the discretion of The Falco Project community. Usually, maintainers can decide to archive a project that has not been maintained for a long time or does not fit the guidelines for the projects under the [falcosecurity](https://falcosecurity) GitHub's organization anymore. In other cases, a repository is archived to reserve its name for future use.

The list of archivied repository can be found [here](https://github.com/falcosecurity?q=&type=archived&language=&sort=name).

### Retired projects

Finally, projects that are no longer maintained or relevant to The Falco Project will be retired definitively. Periodically, the maintainers clean up the [falcosecurity](https://github.com/falcosecurity) and move these projects to the [Falco Projects Retirement Home](https://github.com/falcosecurity-retire) GitHub's organization.
