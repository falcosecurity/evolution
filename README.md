# Falco Contrib

This is a place for various community-maintained resources. In particular, this repository provides a space for the community to work, document, and build out third-party integrations in a safe, and productive way. 

The intention is to give users easier access to them but to keep them separated from the small scope of the officially supported [Falco's artifacts](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco).

## Repo structure

- [`/integrations`](integrations/) - third-party integrations
- [`/examples`](examples/) - various examples
- *More will come soon!*

> When adding a new top-level directory, propose your motivations to the [maintainers](OWNERS).
