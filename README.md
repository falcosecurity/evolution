# Falco Project Evolution

This repository aims to document the evolution process of The Falco Project.

It provides a space for the community to work together, discuss ideas, and document processes. It is also a place to make decisions that regard the whole [falcosecurity](https://github.com/falcosecurity) organization and define rules and structures that span beyond the extent of a single repository.

## Governance

The Falco Project governance model is documented in the [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) file.

## Code Of Conduct

We follow the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

Please contact [cncf-falco-maintainers@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-falco-maintainers@lists.cncf.io) 
or the Linux Foundation mediator, Mishi Choudhary [mishi@linux.com](mailto:mishi@linux.com) to report an issue.

## Maintainers

The process to become a maintainer is documented in the [MAINTAINERS_GUIDELINES.md](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/blob/main/MAINTAINERS_GUIDELINES.md) file.

You can find the list of current maintainers in the [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md) file.

## Repositories

The Falco Project applies a straightforward **adoption model** for its repositories. Each repository is given a *[scope](./REPOSITORIES.md#scope)*, which outlines its purpose, and a *[status](./REPOSITORIES.md#status)* that indicates its maturity level.

For more detailed information, please refer to the [REPOSITORIES.md](./REPOSITORIES.md) file.

In the sections that follow, we present the repositories, grouped by their *scope*.

### Core

Core repositories, as defined by Falco's [governance](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#core-repositories), are critically important as they are essential for building, installing, running, documenting, and using Falco.

### Archived

In general, a repository can be archived at the discretion of The Falco Project community. Usually, maintainers can decide to archive a project that has not been maintained for a long time or does not fit the guidelines for the projects under the [falcosecurity](https://github.com/falcosecurity) GitHub's organization anymore. In other cases, a repository is archived to reserve its name for future use.

The list of archived repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/falcosecurity?q=&type=archived&language=&sort=name).

### Retired

Repositories that are no longer maintained or relevant to The Falco Project will be retired definitively. Periodically, the maintainers clean up the [falcosecurity](https://github.com/falcosecurity) and move these projects to the [Falco Projects Retirement Home](https://github.com/falcosecurity-retire) GitHub's organization.
